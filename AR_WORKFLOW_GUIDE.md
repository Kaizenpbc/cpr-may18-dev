# AR (Accounts Receivable) Workflow Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The AR workflow has been enhanced with **smart safeguards** to ensure professional billing practices and prevent workflow inconsistencies.

## ✅ New Workflow: Option C - Smart Workflow

### **Step 1: Post to Organization (Required First Step)**
- **Action**: Click "Post to Organization" button
- **Result**: Invoice becomes visible in organization's Bills Payable portal

- **Database**: Updates `email_sent_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
- **Purpose**: For follow-ups or if initial email failed

```javascript
// Email endpoint now checks posting status first
if (!invoice.posted_to_org) {
  throw new AppError(400, 'VALIDATION_ERROR',

  );
}
