## Overview
This document outlines the reorganization of fields in the "My Courses" section for organizations and the corresponding updates to admin views to improve clarity and consistency.

## Changes Made

### 1. Organization "My Courses" View

#### Field Order (Left to Right):
1. **Date Submitted** (System Date, uneditable)
2. **Date Scheduled** (Organization's preferred date)
3. **Course Name**
4. **Location**
5. **Students Registered**
6. **Students Attended**
7. **Status**
8. **Notes**

10. **Actions**

#### Updated Components:

- `OrganizationCoursesTable.tsx` - Reusable table component
- `OrganizationDashboard.tsx` - Dashboard recent courses table
- `OrganizationAnalytics.tsx` - Analytics courses table

### 2. Admin Views Updates

- **Preferred Date** (was "Date Requested")
- Organization, Location, Course Name, Students Registered, Notes, Actions

### 3. Field Definitions

#### Date Submitted
- **Purpose**: When the organization submitted the request (system date)
- **Editable**: No (system-generated)
- **Display**: Shows the actual date the request was created
- **User Understanding**: "When did we submit this request?"

#### Date Scheduled
- **Purpose**: Organization's preferred date for the course
- **Editable**: Yes (by organization)
- **Display**: Shows the date the organization wants the course
- **User Understanding**: "When do we want this course?"

#### Students Attended
- **Purpose**: Number of students who actually attended the course
- **Editable**: No (set by instructor after course completion)
- **Display**: Shows actual attendance vs. registration
- **User Understanding**: "How many students actually showed up?"

## Benefits

### 1. Improved Clarity
- Clear distinction between when a request was submitted vs. when the course is wanted
- Separate tracking of registered vs. attended students
- Consistent terminology across all views

### 2. Better User Experience
- Organizations can easily see their request submission date
- Clear view of their preferred date vs. actual scheduled date
- Better understanding of course attendance

### 3. Enhanced Admin Workflow
- Admins can see the original request date for audit purposes
- Clear view of organization preferences vs. confirmed dates
- Better tracking of student attendance

## Technical Implementation

### Database Fields Used:
- `request_submitted_date` - When organization submitted request
- `scheduled_date` - Organization's preferred date
- `confirmed_date` - Actual confirmed date (admin set)
- `registered_students` - Number of students registered
- `students_attended` - Number of students who attended

### Frontend Changes:
- Updated all table headers to use new terminology
- Reorganized field order for better logical flow
- Added Students Attended column where appropriate
- Updated data display to use correct field names

### Backend Compatibility:
- All changes use existing database fields
- No database schema changes required
- Maintains backward compatibility

## User Workflow

### Organization User:
1. Submits course request â†’ **Date Submitted** is set automatically
2. Can update **Date Scheduled** (preferred date) as needed
3. Views **Students Registered** vs. **Students Attended** after course completion
4. Sees **Confirmed Date** when admin assigns instructor

### Admin User:
1. Views **Date Submitted** to see when request was made
2. Sees **Preferred Date** to understand organization's preference
3. Sets **Confirmed Date** when assigning instructor
4. Tracks **Students Attended** for billing and reporting

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create new course request** - Verify Date Submitted is set correctly
2. **Update preferred date** - Verify Date Scheduled can be modified
3. **Assign instructor** - Verify Confirmed Date is set by admin
4. **Mark attendance** - Verify Students Attended is updated
5. **View different portals** - Verify correct labels in each context

## Future Considerations

1. **Email Notifications** - Update to use new field terminology
2. **Reports** - Update any custom reports to use new field names
3. **API Documentation** - Update to reflect new field structure
4. **User Training** - Provide training on new field meanings
