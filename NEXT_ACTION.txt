# NEXT ACTION

## Current State
- Vite dev server starts, but no JavaScript (including minimal test.js) is being served or executed.
- index.html loads, Vite HMR client connects, but no app code runs and no errors are shown.
- Backend server is running and reachable.
- All troubleshooting steps (clean install, cache clear, minimal test, different ports) have been tried.

## Next Action After Restart
1. **Restart your laptop.**
2. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\gerog\Documents\cpr-may18-dev\frontend
   ```
3. Start the Vite dev server with debug logging:
   ```
   npx vite --port 5173 --debug
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to:
   - http://localhost:5173/
   - http://localhost:5173/index.html
5. Check if you see either your app or the message 'Test JS Loaded'.
6. If you still see a blank page or nothing loads:
   - Check the browser Network tab for `/src/test.js` or `/src/main.tsx`.
   - Check the Console for any errors.
7. If the problem persists, try creating a new Vite project in a new directory to see if the issue is system-wide.
